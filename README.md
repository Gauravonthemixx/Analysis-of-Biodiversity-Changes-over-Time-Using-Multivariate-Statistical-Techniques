## :pencil: Description
* This project aims to investigate the changes in biodiversity over time using statistical analysis methods.
  
* It involves analyzing species richness data collected from various locations over two time periods, examining the relationships between different taxonomic groups and environmental factors, and exploring trends in biodiversity over time.

## ‚åõ Dataset:
* The dataset consists of species richness data for seven taxonomic groups (Bees, Bryophytes, Butterflies, Carabids, Hoverflies, Isopods, Vascular plants) collected from multiple locations over two time periods (Y70 and Y00). 
* Each observation includes the species richness for each taxonomic group, the geographical coordinates (Easting and Northing), and the time period.

## üñ•Ô∏è Methods:

### Data Preprocessing:

* The dataset is loaded and filtered to include only the relevant taxonomic groups and time periods.
* The mean biodiversity measure (BD7) is calculated for each observation based on the species richness of the seven taxonomic groups.
### Univariate Analysis:

* Box plots and bar graphs are created to visualize the distribution of species richness for each taxonomic group across different locations and time periods.
### Correlation Analysis:

* The correlation between species richness of different taxonomic groups is calculated to understand their relationships.
### Hypothesis Testing:

* Z-tests and two-tailed t-tests are performed to compare the mean biodiversity measures between two time periods (Y70 and Y00).
### Linear Regression:

* Linear regression models are built to investigate the relationship between species richness and environmental factors (Easting, Northing, time period) for each taxonomic group.
### Multivariate Analysis:

* Multiple linear regression is conducted to explore the combined effect of environmental variables on biodiversity.

## Results:


* Significant differences in biodiversity measures are observed between the two time periods.
* Positive correlations are found between certain taxonomic groups, indicating co-occurrence patterns.
* Linear regression analysis reveals relationships between species richness and environmental factors, suggesting potential drivers of biodiversity changes.
* Multivariate analysis highlights the collective influence of environmental variables on overall biodiversity.
